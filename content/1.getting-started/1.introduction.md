description: A brief overview of UI Thing for Nuxt, its philosophy, and how it differs from traditional component libraries.
---

**UI Thing** is a collection of beautifully designed, reusable UI components built specifically for **Nuxt**, powered by Reka UI and Tailwind CSS. This project is inspired by **shadcn/ui**, with adaptations to fit Nuxt's framework and developer ecosystem.

> **Note:** This is _not_ a traditional component library you install via npm. Instead, it hands you open, editable code-so you can pick the components you need, copy them into your app, and customize as you see fit.

## Why "UI Thing" for Nuxt?

- **Open Code Philosophy**  
  Every component is fully visible and editable-no wrappers or opaque abstractions. This gives you full control to adapt the UI to your design system. This makes it especially AI-friendly, letting models read, understand, and even generate new components.

- **Nuxt-Native**  
  Created with the Nuxt ecosystem at heart, UI Thing respects Nuxt's conventions-whether you're on Nuxt 3 or upgrading to Nuxt 4-and integrates smoothly with your app's structure and tooling.

- **DIY, Your Way**  
  Rather than bundling code you can't touch, UI Thing encourages you to copy, paste, and personalize any component. The code becomes entirely yours-no extra layers, no wrappers.

- **Learn & Build**  
  This project started as an experiment-and a fun one at that. I wanted to explore building an entire component reference for Nuxt, and along the way, I created a CLI to streamline the dev experience.

## How to Use It

1. **Browse** [component](/components/accordion) docs and [examples](/examples/cards).
2. **Use the CLI** (`npx ui-thing@latest add <component>`) to scaffold components into your project, or copy-paste code manually.
3. **Customize** each component freely-tweak styles, logic, responsive behavior, or layout as needed.
