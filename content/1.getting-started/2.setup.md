So you want to use UI Thing in your Nuxt project? Great! This guide will walk you through the steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use UI Thing, you need to have a Nuxt project. If you don't have one yet, you can create one with the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-app
```

This will create a new Nuxt project in the `my-app` directory. You can then navigate to that directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-app && npm run dev
```

## Initialization

Once you have a Nuxt project, you can initialize UI Thing with the following command:

```bash
npx ui-thing@latest init
```

This command will ask you a bunch of question the first time you run it

```bash
✔ Which theme do you want to start with? › Violet
✔ Where is your tailwind.css file located? … app/assets/css/tailwind.css
✔ Where should your components be stored? … app/components/Ui
✔ Where should your composables be stored? … app/composables
✔ Where should your plugins be stored? … app/plugins
✔ Where should your utils be stored? … app/utils
✔ Should we just replace component files if they already exist? … yes
✔ Would you like to use the default filename when adding components? … yes
✔ Which package manager do you use? › Npm
```

## Adding components

Once initialized, add components by running:

```bash
npx ui-thing@latest add
```

You'll be prompted to select the components you want.

**UI Thing** will then:

- Copy the selected components into your components directory
- Add any required composables, utils, and plugins
- Install missing dependencies
- Update `nuxt.config` with necessary configuration

## Adding themes

UI Thing ships with several pre-made themes.

Add one to your project with:

```bash
npx ui-thing@latest theme
```

This will ask you to select the theme you want to add to your project. Once you have selected a theme, UI Thing will ask you if you want to overwrite your `tailwind.css` file. If you answer yes, it will overwrite your `tailwind.css` file with the theme you selected.

⚠️ Please note that this will overwrite your `tailwind.css` file. If you have made any changes to this file, you will lose them.

### Theme source

The themes included in this cli all come from [shadcn/ui theme page](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes).

So if you don't want to use this CLI to add themes, you can just customize your theme on that page and copy the code into your `tailwind.css` file.

> Thanks shadcn for making these themes available for free! 🙏
