# Building a Modern Web Application

::prose-lead
In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the essential components and best practices for building a modern web application. From setting up your development environment to deploying to production, we'll cover everything you need to know.
::

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the code, let's understand what makes a modern web application. **Modern web apps** are characterized by their _responsiveness_, _performance_, and _user experience_. They leverage cutting-edge technologies to deliver seamless interactions across all devices.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

::prose-icon-list{variant="info"}

Node.js (v18 or higher)

A modern code editor like VS Code

Git for version control

Basic understanding of the command line

::

#### Additional Tools

For an optimal development experience, consider installing these optional tools:

::prose-icon-list{variant="info"}
::prose-li{icon="lucide:package"}
Package manager like pnpm or yarn
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:terminal"}
Terminal enhancer like Oh My Zsh
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:chrome"}
Browser DevTools extensions
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:git-branch"}
Git GUI client (optional)
::
::

---

## Installation Process

Let's start by setting up our project. Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Create a new project directory**
2. **Initialize your package manager**
3. **Install dependencies**
4. **Configure your build tools**

### Step 1: Project Initialization

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

::prose-code-group

```bash [npm] icon="devicon:npm" hideHeader
npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

```bash [pnpm] icon="devicon:pnpm" hideHeader
pnpm create vite my-app
cd my-app
pnpm install
```

```bash [yarn] icon="devicon:yarn" hideHeader
yarn create vite my-app
cd my-app
yarn install
```

```bash [bun] icon="devicon:bun" hideHeader
bun create vite my-app
cd my-app
bun install
```

::

### Step 2: Project Structure

Your project should now have the following structure:

::prose-code-tree{defaultValue="src/App.vue" expandAll}

```vue [src/App.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

```ts [src/main.ts]
import { createApp } from "vue";

import App from "./App.vue";

createApp(App).mount("#app");
```

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

```html [index.html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Core Concepts

> The secret to building great applications is understanding the fundamentals and applying them consistently. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code that others can easily understand and extend.

### Component Architecture

Modern frameworks encourage a component-based architecture. Here's what you need to know:

::prose-icon-list{variant="default"}
::prose-li{icon="lucide:box"}
**Encapsulation**: Each component manages its own state and logic
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:repeat"}
**Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere with proper abstractions
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:layers"}
**Composition**: Build complex UIs from simple, focused components
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:workflow"}
**Data Flow**: Understand how data moves through your application
::
::

### State Management

As your application grows, managing state becomes crucial:

- **Local State**: Component-specific data using `useState` or `ref`
- **Global State**: Application-wide data using stores or context
- **Server State**: Data fetched from APIs with proper caching
- **URL State**: Navigation and routing parameters

#### State Management Patterns

::prose-tabs{variant="card"}
::div{label="Pinia" icon="logos:pinia"}

```ts
import { defineStore } from "pinia";

export const useUserStore = defineStore("user", {
  state: () => ({
    name: "",
    email: "",
    isAuthenticated: false,
  }),
  actions: {
    login(email: string) {
      this.email = email;
      this.isAuthenticated = true;
    },
    logout() {
      this.email = "";
      this.isAuthenticated = false;
    },
  },
});
```

::

::div{label="Vuex" icon="logos:vue"}

```ts
import { createStore } from "vuex";

export default createStore({
  state: {
    user: {
      name: "",
      email: "",
      isAuthenticated: false,
    },
  },
  mutations: {
    SET_USER(state, user) {
      state.user = user;
    },
  },
  actions: {
    login({ commit }, userData) {
      commit("SET_USER", userData);
    },
  },
});
```

::

::div{label="Composition API" icon="logos:typescript-icon"}

```ts
import { computed, ref } from "vue";

export function useAuth() {
  const user = ref(null);
  const isAuthenticated = computed(() => !!user.value);

  const login = async (credentials) => {
    user.value = await loginUser(credentials);
  };

  const logout = () => {
    user.value = null;
  };

  return { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout };
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Optimizing your application is critical for user experience. Here are the key areas to focus on:

| Technique          | Impact | Difficulty | Priority     |
| :----------------- | :----- | :--------- | :----------- |
| Code Splitting     | High   | Medium     | Must Have    |
| Lazy Loading       | High   | Easy       | Must Have    |
| Image Optimization | High   | Easy       | Must Have    |
| Caching Strategy   | Medium | Medium     | Should Have  |
| Bundle Analysis    | Medium | Easy       | Should Have  |
| Tree Shaking       | Low    | Auto       | Nice to Have |

### Common Pitfalls

::prose-icon-list{variant="warning"}
::prose-li{icon="lucide:alert-triangle"}
**Over-optimization**: Don't optimize prematurely. Measure first, then optimize
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:zap-off"}
**Ignoring Bundle Size**: Large bundles slow down initial load time
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:refresh-cw"}
**Too Many Re-renders**: Unnecessary re-renders waste CPU cycles
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:database"}
**Poor Data Fetching**: Fetch data efficiently and cache when possible
::
::

---

## Styling Approaches

There are several ways to style your components:

1. **Traditional CSS**: Separate CSS files with class-based styling
2. **CSS Modules**: Scoped styles that won't leak globally
3. **CSS-in-JS**: Write styles in JavaScript with dynamic values
4. **Utility-First**: Use frameworks like Tailwind CSS
5. **Component Libraries**: Pre-styled components you can customize

### Example with Tailwind CSS

::prose-tabs{variant="line"}
::div{label="Component"}

```vue
<template>
  <button
    class="bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 focus-visible:ring-ring rounded-lg px-4 py-2 font-semibold shadow-sm transition-colors focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:outline-none disabled:opacity-50"
  >
    Click me
  </button>
</template>
```

::

::div{label="With Variants"}

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { tv } from "tailwind-variants";

  const button = tv({
    base: "rounded-lg px-4 py-2 font-semibold transition-colors",
    variants: {
      variant: {
        primary: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
        secondary: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/90",
        outline: "border-primary text-primary hover:bg-primary/10 border-2",
      },
      size: {
        sm: "px-3 py-1.5 text-sm",
        md: "px-4 py-2",
        lg: "px-6 py-3 text-lg",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "primary",
      size: "md",
    },
  });
</script>

<template>
  <button :class="button({ variant, size })">Click me</button>
</template>
```

::
::

---

## Testing Strategy

::Callout{variant="success"}

A well-tested application is easier to maintain and refactor.

::

Your testing strategy should include multiple layers:

::prose-icon-list
::prose-li{icon="lucide:check-circle" variant="success"}
**Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:puzzle" variant="success"}
**Integration Tests**: Verify that different parts work together correctly
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:monitor" variant="success"}
**E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows from start to finish
::
::prose-li{icon="lucide:eye" variant="info"}
**Visual Regression**: Catch unintended UI changes automatically
::
::

### Testing Tools Comparison

| :-------------- | :---------- | :------------- | :-------------------- |
| Vitest          | Unit        | Easy           | Component testing     |
| Jest            | Unit        | Easy           | General testing       |
| Cypress         | E2E         | Medium         | User flows            |
| Playwright      | E2E         | Medium         | Cross-browser testing |
| Testing Library | Integration | Easy           | React/Vue components  |
