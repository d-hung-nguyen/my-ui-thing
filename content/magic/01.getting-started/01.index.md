title: Magic UI for UI Thing
description: Use Magic UI components directly inside UI Thing.
---

If you've ever checked out [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/), you know it's a slick collection of modern components and templates.

Now you can use those same components inside **UI Thing** - no React, no rewiring. Just Nuxt-first code.

This isn't a "new thing"... It's more like an **expansion pack**.

I'm porting the Magic UI components over so you can drop them right into your UI Thing project and keep moving fast.

## Why This Matters

- You don't have to hunt down or reimplement Magic UI ideas in Nuxt.
- Everything comes styled and themeable the UI Thing way.
- It stays consistent with the rest of your Nuxt setup.

## What to Expect

- **1:1 ports** of Magic UI components where possible.
- **Nuxt-optimized tweaks** where it makes sense.

## Credits & Inspiration

- Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- Adapted from [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/)
- Reimagined for the Nuxt community through **UI Thing**
